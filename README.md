# BugBuzzer - Community sourced Bug reporting and Q&A Platform

## Problem we are solving:

Currently while contributing in tech forums , developers are being given an illusion
of getting value in the form of â€œ Upvotes or Reputation " which is not real value . Who
gets most value of it ?

And , the way Tech is growing , requirement to finding and fixing bug in applications
is also rapidly increasing . Bugs can be Smart contract security bulnerabilitiy which
can wipe out million , Functional bug which can made us loose the users to UX bug
which kills the WOW factor


## Solution:

BugBuzzer . Com is a platform where developers will be rewarded for their
contribution in the form of NFTs and Cryptocurrencies.


At the same time BugBuzzer is going to provide a platform for the dev from IOT
Hardware domain , UI / UX product design to Blockchain and cybersecurity experts to
report Bugs and help enhance the product .


We have built:

**1) BugBounty Campaign:** Product teams can create NFT Bounty campaign , where
minted batch of NFTs and crypto can be rewarded to Bounty winners.

**2) Q&A Forum:** Developers can ask challenging problems and create NFT of those
bugs / questions or programming challenges .

**3) Support contributors:** Community members can support each other by donating
crypto tokens for their bug reports , answers to questions that will help developers
to create real value for their contribution and to sustain the community work .

**4) Connect with Experts:** People can connect , collaborate and hire expert developers
of the BugBuzzer community .
